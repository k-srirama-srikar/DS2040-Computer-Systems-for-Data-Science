## Question 3

$\text{Consider a machine with byte-addressable main memory of size \( 2^{16} \) bytes.} \\   \text{Assume a direct-mapped cache consisting of 32 lines, each of size 64 bytes, is used in the system. A \( 50 \times 50 \) 2D array of bytes is stored in the main memory starting from memory location \( 0x1100_H \).} \\ \text{Assume that the data cache is initially empty, and the complete array is accessed twice.} \\\text{Also, assume that the contents of the data cache do not change between the two accesses.} \\ \text{Determine the total number of cache misses.}$


To calculate the total number of cache misses for this scenario, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Given:
- **Main memory size**: \( 2^{16} \) bytes (64 KB)
- **Cache configuration**:
  - Direct-mapped cache with **32 lines**.
  - **Each cache line is 64 bytes**.
  
- **Array size**: A 50x50 2D array of bytes, which means the array has \( 50 \times 50 = 2500 \) bytes.

- **Array starts at memory location** `1100_H` (hexadecimal).

- The **data cache is initially empty**, and the array is accessed **twice**.

### Cache Organization:

1. **Cache size**:
   - The cache has **32 lines**, and each line can store **64 bytes**.
   - So, the total cache size is \( 32 \times 64 = 2048 \) bytes (2 KB).

2. **Address breakdown**:
   - The total number of memory blocks is \( \frac{2^{16}}{64} = 2^{10} = 1024 \) blocks (since each block is 64 bytes).
   - The cache is **direct-mapped**, meaning each block from main memory can map to exactly one cache line. The cache has 32 lines, so we need to map the memory blocks to these 32 cache lines.

   The address breakdown for a memory address is as follows:
   - **Block offset**: To access a byte within a 64-byte block, we need 6 bits (since \( 2^6 = 64 \)).
   - **Index**: Since there are 32 cache lines, we need \( \log_2 32 = 5 \) bits to index the cache lines.
   - **Tag**: The remaining bits in the address will be used as the tag. The total address length is 16 bits, so the tag is \( 16 - 6 - 5 = 5 \) bits.

   Therefore, for a given memory address:
   - The **tag** is 5 bits.
   - The **index** is 5 bits.
   - The **block offset** is 6 bits.

### Cache Access Pattern:

1. **Accessing the 50x50 2D array**:
   - The array has \( 50 \times 50 = 2500 \) bytes, and it is stored in memory starting at address `1100_H`.
   - The address of each element in the array can be calculated by starting at `1100_H` and incrementing by 1 for each byte.

2. **Accessing the array twice**:
   - We need to determine how the 50x50 array is laid out in memory. Since each element is 1 byte, the array starts at `1100_H` and goes to `1100_H + 2500 - 1 = 9C3_H`.
   - When the array is accessed for the first time, there will be cache misses as the data is loaded into the cache.
   - When the array is accessed again, since the cache contents do not change between accesses, it will result in **cache hits** for all elements that are already loaded.

### Cache Misses:

#### First Access:
- Each 64-byte block in the cache can hold data for multiple elements. Since the array is accessed row-wise, the number of **cache misses** for the first access is determined by how the blocks of the array map to the cache lines.

   - The array starts at `1100_H`, and we need to calculate how many blocks the array spans. Since each block is 64 bytes, the number of blocks needed to store the 2500-byte array is:
     \[
     \frac{2500}{64} = 39 \text{ blocks} \text{ (rounded up)}
     \]
   - Therefore, the first access will cause **39 cache misses** because we need to load 39 blocks into the cache.

#### Second Access:
- For the second access, since the data cache does not change between accesses, **all the blocks will already be in the cache**, resulting in **0 cache misses** for the second access.

### Total Cache Misses:
- The **first access** causes **39 cache misses**.
- The **second access** causes **0 cache misses** (since the cache is already populated with the necessary data).

Thus, the **total number of cache misses** is:

\[
\boxed{39}
\]
